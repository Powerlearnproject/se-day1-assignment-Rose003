Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1940s — 1950s
The roots of software engineering can be traced back to the era of early computers, such as the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), which was completed in 1945, and the UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer), which was delivered in 1951. During this period, programming was often seen as a part of hardware development. Computer programs were created using machine-level instructions, a tedious and error-prone process.

1950s — 1960s
The emergence of high-level programming languages revolutionized software development. FORTRAN (Formula Translation), developed in 1957, and COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), introduced in 1959, allowed programmers to write code using more human-readable instructions. This made the programming process more efficient and accessible, paving the way for more complex and reliable software systems.

1960s — 1970s
During this period, several influential programming languages were developed. ALGOL (Algorithmic Language), introduced in 1958, laid the groundwork for many modern languages with its structured programming approach. BASIC (Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), created in 1964, made programming more accessible to a broader audienceC, developed in 1972, became one of the most widely used programming languages due to its efficiency and flexibility.

1980s — 1990s
The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with languages like C++ (1983) and Python (1991). Python, created by Guido van Rossum, emphasized code readability and simplicity, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experts2Java, introduced in 1995, also became significant for its portability and extensive use in web development.

2000s — Present
In the 2000s and beyond, programming languages have continued to evolve to meet the demands of modern software development. JavaScript, initially created in 1995, became essential for web development. Swift, introduced by Apple in 2014, provided a modern language for iOS and macOS developmentRust, first released in 2010, gained popularity for its focus on safety and performance.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
This initial phase involves defining the project’s scope, objectives, and feasibility. It includes gathering business requirements from stakeholders, evaluating the project’s potential, and creating a project plan that outlines the necessary resources, timeline, and risks.

2. Requirements Analysis
In this phase, detailed requirements are gathered and documented. The goal is to understand what the software needs to do and the expectations of the end-users. This involves conducting interviews, surveys, and focus groups to gather comprehensive requirements.

3. Design
The design phase translates the requirements into a blueprint for the software. This includes creating architectural designs, data models, and user interfaces. The design serves as a guide for developers and ensures that all components will work together seamlessly.

4. Development
During the development phase, the actual coding of the software takes place. Developers write the code based on the design specifications, and the software begins to take shape. This phase often involves multiple iterations and collaboration among team members.

5. Testing
Testing is crucial to ensure the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. This phase involves various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. Bugs and issues are identified and resolved.

6. Deployment
Once the software has been thoroughly tested and is deemed ready for release, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase includes installation, configuration, and making the software available to users. Deployment may also involve training users and providing documentation.

7. Maintenance
After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves monitoring the software for any issues, providing updates and enhancements, and ensuring it continues to meet user needs. Maintenance is an ongoing process that ensures the software remains functional and relevant.
